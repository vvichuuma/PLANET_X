 	 <h4>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.[13][14] It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive.[15][16][17] Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (â™„) represents the god's sickle.The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 62 moons[20] are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named. This does not include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[21]
